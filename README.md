[Documentation](https://docs.rs/liblzma)

Bindings to the liblzma implementation in Rust, also provides types to
read/write xz streams.

**This crate is forked from [xz2](https://crates.io/crates/xz2) and `liblzma = "0.1.x"` is fully compatible with `xz2 = "0.1.7"`,**
so you can migrate simply.

## Migrate from xz2

```diff
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
-xz2 = "0.1.7"
+liblzma = "0.1.7"
```

```diff
// *.rs
-use xz2;
+use liblzma;
```

## Version 0.2.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.4
- Multithreading is disabled by default.
  This feature is available by enabling the `parallel` feature
- Support for compiling to WebAssembly

## Version 0.3.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.6

## Version 0.4.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.8
- Dropped `tokio` support (If you need async I/O, use [`async-compression`](https://github.com/Nullus157/async-compression) crate with `lzma` feature flag)

## Backend selection

The default build uses the pure Rust backend via `xz-sys`.

Use the original C backend only when you explicitly opt into it:

```toml
liblzma = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["liblzma-sys"] }
```
