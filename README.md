[Documentation](https://docs.rs/xz)

Pure Rust xz2/liblzma-compatible crates for reading and writing xz streams.

**This crate is forked from [xz2](https://crates.io/crates/xz2) and `xz = "0.1.x"` is fully compatible with `xz2 = "0.1.7"`,**
so you can migrate simply.

## Migrate from xz2

```diff
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
-xz2 = "0.1.7"
+xz = "0.1.7"
```

```diff
// *.rs
-use xz2;
+use xz;
```

## Version 0.2.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.4
- Multithreading is disabled by default.
  This feature is available by enabling the `parallel` feature
- Support for compiling to WebAssembly

## Version 0.3.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.6

## Version 0.4.x breaking changes

- XZ upgraded to 5.8
- Dropped `tokio` support (If you need async I/O, use [`async-compression`](https://github.com/Nullus157/async-compression) crate with `lzma` feature flag)

## Crates and backend selection

This repository contains three pure Rust crates:

- `xz-core` is a direct port of the xz C library internals.
- `xz-sys` is a C ABI compatibility layer backed by `xz-core`. It is intended
  to be compatible with `xz2-sys` and `liblzma-sys`, and should be easy to link
  from C as a liblzma-compatible library.
- `xz` is the high-level Rust interface intended as a replacement for `xz2`
  and `liblzma`.

The high-level `xz` crate defaults to the pure Rust `xz-core` backend. You can
disable default features and choose exactly one backend explicitly:

- `xz-core` calls the pure Rust core directly.
- `xz-sys` calls the pure Rust core through the liblzma-compatible C ABI layer.
- `liblzma-sys` calls the original C liblzma implementation.

To use the original C backend:

```toml
xz = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["liblzma-sys"] }
```
